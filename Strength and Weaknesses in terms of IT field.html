          <p class="style9">My first choice course is multimedia, because I know myself I have skills at photography, since I’m a part time photographer and videographer. I wanted to make short film and movies of my own ideas and creativity. But then I’m enlightened to finish this course BSIT, because everything can be learned by a person who wanted to learn. So I'm aiming it to finish my course, I told myself 2 years ago, I wrote on my batch shirt "Future Programmer" and now I’m here as an BSIT, PLP student I'm going to make it come true. Hopefully I and my classmate will do it till the end of our school year 2024.</p>

                <p class="style9" align="center">At first my decision is I'm not going to continue this course BSIT, because I know myself I'm not good at programming. But then I joined a lot of Programmer and Developer at Facebook groups, because I wanted know how programming works, I’m so curios at programming because in my Senior High School, my school batch doesn’t have programming, we're only focuses on hardware. As an IT student, I've been there struggling and experiencing these IT activities I'm on more hardware than software, and I must say software is my weaknesses. </p>
